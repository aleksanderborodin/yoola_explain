# Extension (Chrome MV3, vanilla JS — no build step)

Principle: **auto-detect, never auto-summarize.** Nothing leaves the page until
the user acts (detection tab, popup, or right-click). `background.js` is the only
file that touches the network.

## Triggers (three ways in)

1. **Detection tab** — appears bottom-right when the page is detected (see below).
   On a consent page it reads *Check the terms first?* and summarizes the
   **linked** documents in place (a picker appears when there are several).
2. **Popup button** — "Summarize this page", for anything.
3. **Right-click** — *Summarize this page with Yoola* on the page, or
   *Summarize linked document with Yoola* on a Terms/Privacy **link** — the
   linked doc is summarized without navigating (the server fetches by URL, so
   being on the page is never required).

## Detection (four signals, cheapest first, none phones home per page)

`detect.js#yoolaDetect()` returns `{kind, links}` with kind
`"heuristic" | "registry" | "links"`, or `null`:
1. cheap local gate (URL path / title regex);
2. marker-density scan (only if #1 passes);
3. **registry membership** — the extension normalizes the current URL, hashes
   it, and checks it against a locally-cached digest of known verified URLs
   (`GET /v1/registry`, synced every few hours by the worker). This is how a
   page one user added via right-click lights up ("Summary available") for
   everyone else even when the heuristic would miss it — with no per-visit
   network call, so the "no browsing history" line holds.
4. **consent context** (`kind: "links"`) — a signup/checkout moment (password
   field, or an "I agree…" checkbox naming terms) that links to legal documents
   (`yoolaFindLegalLinks`, ≤4). This closes the registration-page gap: the user
   reviews the terms without leaving the form. In this remote mode, quote
   buttons become *read at source ↗* and deep-link into the original via a
   `#:~:text=` fragment instead of highlighting the current page.

## Files

- `manifest.json` — MV3. Content scripts on `<all_urls>`; permissions:
  `storage`, `activeTab`, `contextMenus`, `alarms`. Host permissions only for
  the API origins.
- `detect.js` — detection, URL normalization (mirrors the server), registry
  lookup, and the crude `<main>/<article>/body` fallback extractor
  (`yoolaExtractText`, used ONLY for the server-fetch-failed path).
- `content.js` — the detection tab + the shadow-DOM "dossier" panel: the
  **verdict stamp** (A–E seal, the signature element), alerts-first cards,
  in-brief bullets, collapsible full checklist, disputed/unverified warnings,
  per-clause "report wrong", quote highlighting. Styled to match the website:
  warm paper, ink type, colored stamp seals (one visual system across product).
- `background.js` — service worker. Per request: L1 → `GET /v1/summary` →
  `POST /v1/summary` (→ on 502, asks content for `clientContent` and retries).
  Owns the L1 LRU cache, the badge, the right-click menu, and `syncRegistry()`.
  `API_BASE` constant at the top (dev: `127.0.0.1:8000`).
- `popup/` — manual "Summarize this page", dossier-styled.

## Message contract (content ⇄ background)

| type | direction | payload | reply |
|------|-----------|---------|-------|
| `detected` | content → bg | — | sets tab badge |
| `summarize` | content → bg | `{url, language, clientContent?}` | `{ok, payload, fromL1?}` \| `{ok:false, needClientContent:true}` \| `{ok:false, detail}` |
| `report` | content → bg | `{docVersion, category}` | `{ok}` |
| `summarize-current` | popup/bg/context-menu → content | — | panel for the current page |
| `summarize-url` | bg (link context-menu) → content | `{url}` | panel for the linked document (remote mode) |

## L1 cache

`chrome.storage.local`, keys `l1:<url>:<lang>`, LRU-capped at 50 entries.
Entries older than 7 days are treated as stale: the worker re-POSTs so the
server can revalidate (the server re-fetches, and an unchanged page costs
nothing). If the server is unreachable, a stale L1 entry is served rather than
nothing.

## Quote highlighting

Offsets are useless in the live DOM (v4 C4) — `content.js#highlight` searches
for the quote text itself via `window.find`, shrinking the needle
(full → 80 → 50 → 30 chars) until it matches. Failure is silent by design.

## Known limits (roadmap)

`API_BASE` should become an options-page setting; extraction fallback is crude
(server-side fetch is the primary path, so this rarely matters); no
Firefox port yet. Chrome's PDF viewer blocks content scripts entirely, so on a
directly-opened PDF the pill/panel cannot appear and the popup explains the
right-click-the-link route (the server itself summarizes PDFs fine).
